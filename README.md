# Resolving GitHub Authentication Errors for Push Operations

If you encounter the error:

```bash
git push
Username for 'https://github.com': your_username
Password for 'https://your_username@github.com':
remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021.
remote: Please see https://docs.github.com/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-https-urls for information on currently recommended modes of authentication.
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git/'
```

This happens because GitHub no longer supports password authentication for Git operations over HTTPS. Follow one of the solutions below to resolve this issue.

## **Option 1: Use a Personal Access Token (PAT)**

### Step 1: Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT)
1. Navigate to [GitHub Personal Access Tokens settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
2. Click **Generate new token** (or **Generate new token (classic)** if using the older interface).
3. Set the following:
   - **Scopes**: Select the required scopes (e.g., `repo` for repository access).
   - **Expiration**: Choose an expiration duration (e.g., 30 days).
4. Generate the token and **copy it**. You will not be able to view it again, so save it securely.

### Step 2: Use the Token in Git
1. When pushing to GitHub, replace your password with the token.
   ```bash
   git push
   Username for 'https://github.com': your_username
   Password for 'https://your_username@github.com': [paste your token here]
   ```

2. (Optional) Save the token in Git credentials for future use:
   ```bash
   git config --global credential.helper store
   ```
   After running this command, push again and provide your username and token. Git will remember your credentials.

## **Option 2: Switch to SSH Authentication**

### Step 1: Generate an SSH Key
1. Generate a new SSH key on your local machine:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
   Replace `your_email@example.com` with the email associated with your GitHub account.
2. Save the key in the default location (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`) and optionally set a passphrase.

### Step 2: Add the SSH Key to GitHub
1. Copy the public key to your clipboard:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```
2. Go to [GitHub SSH settings](https://github.com/settings/keys) and click **New SSH key**.
3. Paste your public key, add a descriptive title, and click **Add SSH key**.

### Step 3: Update Your Git Repository URL
1. Change the remote URL to use SSH:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:your_username/your_repository.git
   ```
2. Test the connection:
   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```
   If successful, you will see a message like:
   ```
   Hi your_username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
   ```
3. Push your changes:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

## **Option 3: Use HTTPS with a Token in the URL (Temporary Solution)**

If you prefer to quickly push without configuring SSH or credentials storage:

1. Use this format in the remote URL:
   ```bash
   https://<your_token>@github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
   ```
   Replace `<your_token>` with your PAT.

2. Push your changes:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

By following these steps, you will successfully authenticate and push to GitHub without password errors. If you have any trouble, double-check your setup or consult GitHub's documentation for further guidance.
