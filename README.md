Resolving GitHub Authentication Errors for Push Operations

If you encounter the error:

```bash
git push
Username for 'https://github.com': your_username
Password for 'https://your_username@github.com':
remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021.
remote: Please see https://docs.github.com/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-https-urls for information on currently recommended modes of authentication.
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git/'
```

This happens because GitHub no longer supports password authentication for Git operations over HTTPS. Follow these simple steps to fix it.

## **Option 1: Use a Personal Access Token (PAT)**

### Step 1: Create a Personal Access Token (PAT)
1. Go to [GitHub Personal Access Tokens settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
2. Click **Generate new token** (or **Generate new token (classic)**).
3. Choose the following settings:
   - **Scopes**: Select the options you need (e.g., `repo` to access repositories).
   - **Expiration**: Set how long the token should last (e.g., 30 days).
4. Click **Generate token** and **copy the token**. Save it securely because you won’t see it again.

### Step 2: Use the Token in Git
1. When pushing to GitHub, use your token as the password:
   ```bash
   git push
   Username for 'https://github.com': your_username
   Password for 'https://your_username@github.com': [paste your token here]
   ```

2. Save the token for future use (optional):
   ```bash
   git config --global credential.helper store
   ```
   After running this, Git will remember your token next time you push.

## **Option 2: Use SSH for Authentication**

### Step 1: Generate an SSH Key
1. Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen
   ```
   This will create a new SSH key.
2. Press `Enter` to save the key in the default location (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`).
3. When asked for a passphrase, press `Enter` if you don’t want one (or type a passphrase for extra security).

### Step 2: Add the Key to GitHub
1. Copy the key to your clipboard:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```
   Copy everything shown in the terminal.
2. Go to [GitHub SSH settings](https://github.com/settings/keys).
3. Click **New SSH Key**, paste the key, and save it.

### Step 3: Test the SSH Connection
1. Run this command to check if it works:
   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```
2. You should see a message like this:
   ```
   Hi your_username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
   ```

### Step 4: Update Your Repository to Use SSH
1. Change your GitHub URL to use SSH:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:your_username/your_repository.git
   ```
2. Push your changes:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

## **Option 3: Use HTTPS with a Token in the URL (Quick Fix)**

If you want a quick solution without setting up SSH or saving tokens:
1. Change your repository URL to include the token:
   ```bash
   https://<your_token>@github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
   ```
2. Push your changes:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

By following these steps, you’ll be able to push to GitHub without any errors. Choose the method that works best for you!
